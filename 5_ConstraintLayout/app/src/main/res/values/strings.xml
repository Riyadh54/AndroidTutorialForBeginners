        Muscat, Arabic Masqaṭ, town, capital of Oman,
        located on the Gulf of Oman coast.
        The town long gave its name to the country,
        which was called Muscat and Oman until 1970.
        Situated on a cove surrounded by volcanic mountains,
        the town is connected by road to the west and the south.
        In 1508 the Portuguese gained control of Muscat and the adjacent coast.
        Until driven out in 1650, they maintained a trading post and naval base there.
        Two 16th-century Portuguese forts overlook the town. Muscat’s old wall still stands,
        as well as some of its gates.
